This project was really fun,was always curious how it'sdone and being on the developer's side this time was so cool.Loved how there are automaed animations that we can choose from.
Working on Unity was very different.


NOTE FOR SIR : Sir,this is Nidhi.My Unity wasn't working from weeks as I told you perviously,so I did it in class today(28th September'2021) as you suggested me to,hence I'm submitting this project one day after the due date,I apologise.
And my Android Studio is not working sir,so I could not add the SDK path,please could you send me the path,I've submitted my google drive zip folder above.
Thank you so much sir for the videos,they were very very informative.
Thank you for viewing my project guys,have a great day!!
Take care and stay healthy :)
